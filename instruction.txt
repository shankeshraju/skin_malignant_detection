# train.py module

1. This module holds the code for training the model with train and test images with resolution 256x256
2. In config.ini you can specify the epochs, train-test data path, image height, width, dimension and output path to store the model and the weights 
3. After training, the model will be stored in the output folder specified in the config file


# app.py module
1. This module uses the saved trained model and weights for inference
2. Uses config.ini output_path location to access the files
3. Preferred input image size is 256x256, If larger image is given, it will resize to desired resolution
4. Outputs cases: Benign and Malignant
